Let G be a complete undirected graph in which all edge lengths are either 1 or 2 (clearly, G satisfies the triangle inequality). Give a 4/3 factor algorithm for TSP in this special class of graphs.  Hint: Start by finding a minimum 2-matching in G. A 2-matching is a subset S of edges so that every vertex has exactly 2 edges of S incident at it.
